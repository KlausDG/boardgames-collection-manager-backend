    "description": "A pantheon from several civilizations &mdash; including Greek, Egyptian, and Middle-Eastern &mdash; gets added to 7 Wonders Duel in 7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon, with each god having its own power to help you or hinder your opponent.&#10;&#10;During Age I you collect mythology tokens &mdash; which allow you to choose which deities have a place in the Pantheon &mdash; and during Age II you collect offering tokens, which help you court those deities. Then, during Ages II and III, you can activate a god or goddess in the Pantheon instead of taking a card from the pyramid. To do so, you pay whatever that god or goddess demands from you in offerings, then place it next to your city.&#10;&#10;With Isis on your side, you can use a card from the discard pile to construct one of your Wonders for free. Zeus, whose nod determines what happens and what does not, enables you to discard any single card from the card structure that you want, as well as any mythology or offering token that may be on it. The Phoenician goddess Tanit, whose people were renowned for trade, fills your coffers with twelve pieces of gold. Enki, the Sumerian god of crafts, technology, and creation, lets you choose one of two progress tokens. Minerva's ability to stop the conflict pawn from moving toward you can assist with a military victory or save you from military defeat.&#10;&#10;What's more, instead of adding three guild cards to the deck for Age III, you add three of five Grand Temples. Each Grand Temple belongs to a different Mediterranean culture, and if you possess a mythology token from that culture, you can build the temple for free. These temples are worth a total of 5, 12, or 21 points, depending on how many you build.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon also includes two new Wonders: the Sanctuary (which gives you an additional turn and allows you to invoke deities at a reduced price) and the Divine Theater (which grants points and access to additional gods).&#10;&#10;",

Organized crime builds a strong foothold in the city, secret cults labor for a dark master, an alien moon hangs overhead, and unknowable horrors stalk the night. This expansion includes two all-new scenarios, new encounters for every location in Arkham, new monsters and anomalies, and four new investigators to face these fresh horrors, armed with new spells, items and allies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "From Fantasy Flight Games:&#10;we have developed an expansion to the AGoT LCG Core Set, and we&rsquo;re calling it the: Kings of the Sea. Kings of the Sea was developed with three major goals in mind:&#10;&#10;The first of these goals was to bring House Greyjoy back into the LCG environment. From this perspective, the expansion consists of a Greyjoy deck that is similar to the out-of-the-box decks that you&rsquo;ll find in the AGoT Core set. With a mixture of both new cards and old school Greyjoy reprints (some modified and updated for the LCG environment), House Greyjoy can once again stand proudly alongside (or, if you prefer, against) Houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen in the LCG environment.&#10;&#10;Secondly, I insisted on using the design of the Kings of the Sea expansion as an opportunity to address some of the context and synergy concerns noted earlier. In this product, you&rsquo;ll find numerous King and Queen characters, some new Kingdom locations, and a spattering of Military Battle, Intrigue Gambit, and Power Struggle plot cards. Additional use for crested characters is also prevalent (particularly Holy and War), and a major black hole in the AGoT LCG metagame, a realistic check on powerful locations, has been confronted.&#10;&#10;Third (and not unrelated to the context and synergy discussion), we wanted this expansion to have something for everyone, even if they&rsquo;re not at all interested in House Greyjoy. Thus, each House gets at least 1 King or Queen, and the plot deck (with the exception of an important House Greyjoy only plot reprint) along with many of the neutral cards were selected as cards that could potentially be useful building blocks in the widest possible array of decks. So even a die-hard Lannister player (there aren&rsquo;t really any of those out there, are there?) should be able to find something of use in this set.&#10;&#10;",

    "description": "Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;From their seat of power at Casterly Rock, a seat nearly as powerful as the Iron Throne itself in wealth and influence, the rich and powerful lords of House Lannister are raising the banners of war. Beneath the golden lion on a crimson field as red as spilt blood ruthless lords, devious ladies, cunning knights, and vast armies are forming to proclaim to Westeros the words of House Lannister: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;&#10;&#10;Lions of the Rock is the sixth Deluxe Expansion for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, featuring 165 cards new to the LCG card pool &ndash; three copies each of 55 unique cards &ndash; that add deck-building opportunities and strategic depth to your game.&#10;&#10;The cards included in Lions of the Rock deepen the existing strengths of House Lannister, as well as adding some new avenues of strategy to explore. Forming the core of Lions of the Rock are the formidable members of the Lannister family: the ruthless patriarch Tywin, the treacherous queen Cersei, the Kingslayer Jaime, and the beguiling Tyrion. Each wields power as naturally as dragons breathe fire, backed by the limitless wealth of Casterly Rock and the unbreakable will of House Lannister's honor and willingness to repay any debt in blood. As anyone in Westeros will tell you &ndash; a Lannister always pays his debts...&#10;&#10;In-game, each Lannister represents a different approach to victory, around which entire decks could be built, from Tyrion's synergy with the Clansman trait, to Tywin's breathtaking seizure of power based on having lots of gold in play during Dominance, to Cersei's ability to claim power whenever you win intrigue challenges (playing very well into the new The Power Behind the Throne agenda). Working separately, the Lannisters are merely powerful. Working together, the might of the Lannisters can become unstoppable.&#10;&#10;",

Later, while stealing money to pay for his mother&rsquo;s medical care, a chance encounter with a demon left Robbins with a pair of boots that let him walk on air and an equally-mystical red cloak. Now, as the Hood, Robbins and his budding criminal empire are swiftly becoming a formidable threat to the people of New York City.&#10;&#10;This 78-card scenario pack introduces a new scenario to Marvel Champions showcasing the Hood and his notorious organization of supervillains.

One being has established himself as a scourge on all life, whose power is unrivaled across all the cosmos.&#10;&#10;Of course, we are talking about Thanos.&#10;&#10;In this third campaign expansion for Marvel Champions: The Card Game, you and your fellow heroes must challenge the forces of Thanos. This massive expansion contains a brand-new campaign featuring five thrilling scenarios pitting you against members of the zealous Black Order, including Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, and, of course, the Mad Titan himself. As with previous expansions, you can play each of these scenarios individually or as part of a larger campaign, and with a slew of new modular encounter sets, there will be ample opportunity to mix things up for all of your Marvel Champions content. Of course, a new wave of expansions means more heroes as well, and The Mad Titan&rsquo;s Shadow starts it off with the mighty champions Adam Warlock and Spectrum, both of whom come with fully pre-built and ready-to-play decks right out of the box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
